# Cesarean Cypher Project Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Makefile configuration and its usage within the Cesarean Cypher project, developed in C and managed in CLion.

## Overview of Makefile Configuration

The Makefile orchestrates the build process, defining how the Cesarean Cypher is compiled, linked, and executed. It streamlines development by automating tasks such as building the executable, cleaning up artifacts, and running the program.

### Makefile Components

- **Variables**: Define the compiler (`CC`), flags (`CFLAGS`), program name (`PROGRAM`), and paths for artifacts (`BUILD_DIR`, `BIN_DIR`, `OBJ_DIR`).
- **Compilation and Linking**: Specific rules are set for compiling source files to object files and linking these to create the executable.
- **Directory Structure**: Implements a clean separation of source files from build artifacts, organizing executables in `bin` and object files in `obj`, all under a `build` directory.

### Execution and Testing

A special `run` target is included for executing the Cesarean Cypher, facilitating immediate testing post-build.

### Integration with CLion

The project is configured to ensure seamless integration with CLion's build and run capabilities, allowing for an efficient development workflow.

### Error Resolution

Guidance is provided for resolving common build errors, ensuring a smooth development process.

## Understanding the Makefile

The Makefile serves as the backbone of the project's build system, employing:

- **Automation**: Through `make`, compiling and linking tasks are automated based on file dependencies.
- **Modularity**: Variables and targets make the build process adaptable and maintainable.
- **Efficiency**: Phony targets like `clean` and `run` simplify project maintenance and testing.
